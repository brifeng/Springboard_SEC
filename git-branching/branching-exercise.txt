Part I
Answer the following questions:

What git command creates a branch?
git branch

What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
A fast forward merge is between two branches that have linear changes, while a recursive merge
has more interwoven changes. For the purposes of the user, they are essentially the same.

What git command changes to another branch?
git checkout

What git command deletes a branch?
git branch -d, -D

How do merge conflicts happen?
When merging branches that have different changes in the same file, git does not
know which changes are intended to be saved. The user must manually review and save
the changes.
